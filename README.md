# The Candy man

In a world of **darkness** some things should stay secret. This is the story of the *Candy man*. If you go and try to find him you won't but don't matter, he'll find **you**
<br/>When he'll find you he'll probably propose you some **candy!**
<br/> **PLEASE** do not accept those or you're gonna have a problem.
<br/> If you accept those... It's been a pleasure to know you.
Now that you did accept the candy,you've earned the right to quit this dark world, but only for another one far darker.

# The Candy man

In a world of **darkness** some things should stay secret. This is the story of the *Candy man*. If you go and try to find him you won't but don't matter, he'll find **you**
<br/>When he'll find you he'll probably propose you some **candy!**
<br/> **PLEASE** do not accept those or you're gonna have a problem.
<br/> If you accept those... It's been a pleasure to know you.
Now that you did accept the candy,you've earned the right to quit this dark world, but only for another one far darker. As you come to this darker world, **There is no coming back.**  What you can only do is regret accepting those candies. At the moment help is not possible. ***But maybe ...  ***
